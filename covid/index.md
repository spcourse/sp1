# Covid-19 Measures and Scientific Programming

Before coming to the UvA, make sure you're aware of all the Covid measures at the UvA: [Covid measures](https://www.uva.nl/en/current/coronavirus/coronavirus.html).

A couple of things that I'd like to highlight:

- It is the intention that as many as possible people are vaccinated and that everyone (that comes to the UvA) takes a self test twice per week. You can order free self tests [here](https://www.zelftestonderwijs.nl/).

- You cannot come to the UvA if:
    - You have Covid related symptoms (also if you think it's just a cold).
    - If you tested positive for Covid-19 (either by a self test or an official test).

- It is possible to follow Scientific Programming entirely online. There is no requirement to be present and you can get online help with your assignments. So there is no need to come to the UvA in case of doubt. It is also not necessary to come if you're worried about exposure.

- You have to wear a face mask when in the hallways of the campus.

- It can be practical to work at the UvA during the helpdesk hours. If you want to do this, don't forget to [reserve a spot](https://uba.uva.nl/en/visiting-and-studying/book-a-study-space/book-a-study-space.html). A booking at the helpdesk does not automatically come with a study space.

- If you have any worries about anything, please do not hesitate to send me an email at <scientific@mprog.nl>.

- It is not unlikely that some or all of the measures change again soon. We'll see...
