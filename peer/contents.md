# Code review ()

> Warning: do not start code review until you **and** your partner are completely done and you have **both submitted working version of the assignment** you'll discuss. If you haven't finished your program you should ask for help on that specifically and never look at someone else's code.

Learning to assess your own code, and finding ways to improve it, is an important part of learning to program. To get better at this it helps to review the code of someone else and discuss your own code with that person. To learn this, you will do a code review with another student. In the code review, you will give each other feedback and advice on improving your code.

## What to do

1. Find a partner for this exercise.

2.  For this module, you will assess and improve your code along the style guide. Take your time to fully read and grasp the descriptions there before you perform the review with your partner.

3.  Then, you should sit next to your assigned partner. You will take turns as reviewer. Generally, one person talks, the other listens.

    -   Participant #1 gets access to participant #2's computer.

    -   Participant #2 will think aloud while trying to understand the code, and ask questions about what they do not understand.

    -   Participant #2 focuses on listening and making notes, but may answer any questions.

    -   Participant #1 can also provide concrete advice if they feel that this is useful. Participant #2 freely decides what to do with this advice.

    -   When done (after about 10 minutes), switch roles. Do NOT do the reviews of each other's code at the same time.

4.  Finally, take 30--60 minutes or so to improve your programs by considering the feedback that you got in the review. Don't forget to re-read the explanations of the aspects once more. In addition, it is completely acceptable to improve your programs in other ways.

> You don't have to write out the reviews. The review is supposed to be discussed in person. But it is useful to document what you changed after the review and why. You can discuss this with the teacher.
