# Ed
We use Ed as an online discussion platform. Here you can discuss the assignments with other students and also the staff.

* Sign-up [here](https://edstem.org/us/join/uWysvk). You need an UvA-mail address for this. If this doesn't work send, an email to <scientific@mprog.nl>.
* Use the forum: [Ed](https://edstem.org/us/courses/12543/discussion/).
* Please keep the language in English on the forum, as not all students following this course speak Dutch.
* When you use Ed, try to formulate your question clearly. Use code fragments to illustrate the problem. But, *never copy your entire code* here (this would make it too tempting for your fellow students to copy your code).
