# Lab sessions
The lab sessions are the most classic way of getting help with your programming. You'll work on campus (together with other students) in a classroom. You can ask us questions while you're working on your assignments.

* There are lab sessions on campus (Monday and Wednesday between 9:00 and 11:00).
* All these sessions take place on Science Park, check [Datanose](https://datanose.nl/#course[99563]) for precise locations.
* To avoid overcrowding, please book a slot using these links: [Book Monday Lab Session](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/UniversiteitvanAmsterdam1@Amsuni.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/s/DMs1BphJ8U6A--L7PtN9tQ2) or [Book Wednesday Lab Session](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/UniversiteitvanAmsterdam1@Amsuni.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/s/pwL48P3zxEO9vZm-LE6ukQ2). (For the first two weeks, please limit yourselves to only one slot per week, so that everyone has a chance to work on campus.)
* This is a good place to work on your assignments and get immediate help.
* This is the main place where you can meet other students.
* There is no online version of this. If you want to work online, you can always use the helpdesk to talk to an assistant.
