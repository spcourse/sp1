# How to get help?

There are three ways to get help:

**Helpdesk (Programmeerbalie)** (online/on campus): You can book a slot to get to talk directly to an assistant. [Helpdesk info](/help#helpdesk)

**Lab sessions** (on campus): You'll work on campus (together with other students) in a classroom. You can ask us questions while you're working on your assignments. [Lab info](/help#lab-sessions)

**Forum** (online): We use Ed as an online discussion platform. Here you can discuss the assignments with other students and also the staff. [Ed info](/help#ed)

## Helpdesk

* Help is both available on campus (at Science Park) and online.
* Help is available on many moments throughout the week.
* Whether you join online or join on campus, in both cases **you have to make an appointment**. You can make an appointment *up to one day ahead*, using this link: [book a slot](https://balie.mprog.nl/planner/4-scientific-programming)
* When you book a slot, clearly indicate if you plan to join "on campus" or "online".
    * If you choose to join online, use this link: [Online Scientific Programming Lab](https://www.wonder.me/r?id=e57e2eb3-a410-4833-98f5-01b2d982d488)
    * If you choose to join on campus check the schedule above for the location.


## Lab sessions
The lab sessions are the most classic way of getting help with your programming. You'll work on campus (together with other students) in a classroom. You can ask us questions while you're working on your assignments.

* There are lab sessions on campus (Monday afternoon and Wednesday evening).
* All these sessions take place on Science Park. Check [Datanose](https://datanose.nl/#course[99564]) for precise locations.
* *Booking is not needed anymore. You can join these sessions whenever you want.*
* This is a good place to work on your assignments and get immediate help.
* This is the main place where you can meet other students.
* There is no online version of this. If you want to work online, you can always use the helpdesk to talk to an assistant.


## Ed
We use Ed as an online discussion platform. Here you can discuss the assignments with other students and also the staff.

* Sign-up [here](https://canvas.uva.nl/courses/29089/external_tools/15656?display=borderless). You need an UvA-mail address for this. If this doesn't work send, an email to <scientific@mprog.nl>.
* Use the forum: [Ed](https://edstem.org/us/courses/15802/discussion/).
* Please keep the language in English on the forum, as not all students following this course speak Dutch.
* When you use Ed, try to formulate your question clearly. Use code fragments to illustrate the problem. But, *never copy your entire code* here (this would make it too tempting for your fellow students to copy your code).
