# How to get help?

There are three ways to get help:

**Helpdesk (Programmeerbalie)** (online/on campus): You can book a slot to get to talk directly to an assistant. [Helpdesk info](/help/programmeerbalie)

**Lab sessions** (on campus): You'll work on campus (together with other students) in a classroom. You can ask us questions while you're working on your assignments. [Lab info](/help/lab)

**Forum** (online): We use Ed as an online discussion platform. Here you can discuss the assignments with other students and also the staff. [Ed info](/help/forum)
